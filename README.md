Wine is one of the most popular alcoholic drink worldwide. There are many discussion about how to determine the quality of wines. Wine is generally certified through physiochemical tests and sensory tests. Physiochemical tests includes measurement of acidity, pH or alcohol, while the sensory tests are based on human experts. Cortez et al.(2009) tries to predict the sensory aspects, or the ``quality'' with the physiochemical aspects based on mathematical models. 

While the authors of Cortez et al.(2009) use linear models, support vector machine and neural network models to make predictions, we focus on modifying the linear model to make better prediction on the quality of wine. Through these models we can suggest which aspects contribute to the quality of wine, and propose ways to improve wine production.
